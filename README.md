# CULTURE CLUB

### INTRO

_This app was inspired by the ever growing necessity for human connection._

_If in a way we never had such a broad network to rely on, one of the results of the social midia is that we are becoming less social and more isolated in our own beliefes._

_The algorithms used so far help to perpetuate false perceptions and polarize the society._

_There's something magical and unique about being together and sharing thoughts and the tribal spirit that lives in all of us. Together we have the power to build the world that we are living in._

## THE APP

Culture Club original idea was created between friends to stimulate a way to catch up in a more regular basis. The idea is pretty simple.

Every week someone takes charge of the night planning something that everyone can enjoy together. A dinner party, a scape room, a magic show, a burlesque, a jazz gig, you name it. Or even just a simple walk around the block. The important thing is to get together and enjoy the occasion to do something different.

Only the person that is organising knows the plan, everybody else just goes with the flow and enjoy the night (or day). This helps to bring back the old gift of flowing.

Everyone share their availability and the invitations are send just telling the meeting point.

This app that is is still at a developing point has as a final goal to help people to find an event and organise the catch ups by managing schedules and invitations.
